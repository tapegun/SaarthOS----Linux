1)  vertical line not working... solved, error in calculating the index to load the buffer into
2)  trouble loading the buffer to the correct spot in memory.... solved, I wasn't multiplying the destination location offset(1440) by the page number
3)  flashing status bar at the top (hardstuck, will move on) ... solved, I changed teh target_img variable to make it such that the status bar buffer gets put in the right place
4)  mask doesn't cover the trail... solved, wasnt writing the trail after the mask in front.
5)  the time is being displayed seconds first.. I was loading my global variable "buttons" low first then high
6)  floating caption was breaking my game so I removed it.
